All things related to drives, crowns, etc.



<u> Folders with special parts</u>
<li> Crown: 3d printed crown. </li>
<li> SkullBase: bases that provide attachment point for copper mesh shielding/drive protection</li>
<li> Bilateral HPC: tweaks to basic drive design to accomodate bilateral hippocampus implants at the optimal probe angle. <b> Note that verifying drive stability is EXTRA IMPORTANT when using the rotated version of these drives because any wobble will occur in along the long axis of the probe which is MORE BRITTLE</b>
